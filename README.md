Git Branches and PRs
my notes



1. make sure you are on the main folder, create a new branch on the terminal, command: `git switch -c <branchname>`

2. Look with `ls` what is inside the branch

3. Check status with `git status`

4. stage the changes on the terminal with `git add .` or `git add <filename>`

5. Commit the changes with `git commit -m "Meaningful message"` 

6. Push to repository `git push -u origin <branchname>`
from the 2. time use just `git push`

7. On GitHub, a yellow action box should appear, suggesting you create a pull request for the named branch.

8. Wait for response from Seniors or merge the pull request 

GOOD LUCK
